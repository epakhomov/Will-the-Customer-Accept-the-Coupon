# Will the customer accept the coupon?

## Introduction

This readme file provides a summary of findings for Practical Application Assignment 5.1: Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?. 

## The objective and the data

The objective of thes study is to highlight the differences between customers who did and did not accept the coupons. The information about the data is provided in the Jupyter book that can be found here.

## The summary

The summary consists of two parts. The first part was scoped in the assignment and the second one was a free investigation. The summary will not discuss the data preparation steps. Please refer to the Jupyter book for that.

### The data

The data describes five different types of coupons: -- less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carry out & take away, bar, and more expensive restaurants ($20 - $50). As well as the attributes of the drivers like gender, age, income, etc. and also contextual attributes. Please find the full list of attributes in the Jupyter book.

### Part 1

One of the first suggested tasks was to visualize the variety of coupons that the data has (Fig.1).

As we can clearly see that the most common coupon is "Coffe House" as well as the most accepted one.
We also calculated the proportion of the total observations that chose to accept the coupons to be **57%**.

According to the next assignment, we looked closer at the data that contained observations for the "Bar" coupon only.

We calculated the proportion of the total observations that chose to accept the "Bar" coupons to be **41%**.

#### Groups

Then we were given the following groups of observation for the analysis on which group will more likely accept the coupon.

Group 1A: Drivers who went to a bar 3 or fewer times a month.
Group 1B: Drivers who went to a bar more than 3 times a month.

Group 2A: Drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and are over the age of 25.
Group 2B: All other drivers (that is who go to a bar less once a month and are under the age of 25).

Group 3A: Drivers who go to bars more than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry.
Group 3B: All other drivers that do not fall into Group3A.

Group 4A: Drivers that go to bars more than once a month, had passengers that were not a kid, and were not widowed.
Group 4B: Drivers that go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30.
Group 4C: Drivers that go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and income is less than 50K.

#### Acceptance rates

|                    |Group 1A|Group 1B|Group 2A|Group 2B|Group 3A|Group 3B|Group 4A|Group 4B|Group 4C|
|--------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|**Acceptance rate** |  0.37  |  0.77  |  0.7   |  0.33  |  0.71  |  0.3   |  0.71  |  0.72  |  0.46  |

### Discussion

Based on these observations, we can hypothesize the following about the drivers who accepted the bar coupons. The drivers are more likely to accept the coupons if they are:

- Go to a bar often, at least once a month
- Are over the age of 25 and older
- Have passengers that were not a kid
- Not involved in farming, fishing, or forestry industry

### Part 2

Businesses are interested in customers with high income, becuase they likely to spend more money and increase the revenue. The objective of this part is to understand attributes of drivers with high income who would likely accept a coupon.

Let's create a new group 5A for drivers with income 87500âˆ’99999 USD and 100000 USD or more.
Now let's visualize the variety of coupons for this group (Fig.2).
